HabitRPG
============

A habit-tracker which treats your goals like a Role Playing Game.  As you accomplish goals, you earn gold to spend on rewards, and experience points as you level up. When you fail at your goals, you loose hit points. Lose all your HP and you die (aka, have to start over with GP & Lvl).
